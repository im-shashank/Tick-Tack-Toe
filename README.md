# Tick-Tack-Toe
A tick-tack-toe game made godot

Currently in the release:
1. An offline co-op multiplayer where two people can play together on the same computer.
2. Added single player PvE mode to the game.
3. Added multiplayer but it is unstable and I don't have money for dedicated server so the code and logic is there but multiplayer is non functioning.
